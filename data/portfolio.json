When hiking in the Sunrise quadrant of the park, I often find my gaze settling back on this silent sentinel, and this picture is a memory of the pure joy I felt the first time seeing it, and has since become an annual tradition of a hike.",

But to me, this mountain marks a pivotal moment in my life, and when I look east and see her towering in the skyline, I remember how far I've come from my small Midwest home town. I took this photo during an excitingly moody day on top of Third Burroughs Mountain at 7,828 feet. ",
