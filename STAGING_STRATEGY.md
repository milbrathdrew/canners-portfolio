# Staging Strategy for Commit Spam Reduction

## Current Issue
Every photo upload creates multiple commits in the main branch:
1. Image upload commit
2. Portfolio.json update commit
3. Optimized images commit (from GitHub Actions)

This creates "spam" in the main branch history.

## Proposed Solution: Staging Branch Workflow

### Option 1: Staging Branch with Periodic Merges
```
uploads â†’ staging branch â†’ batch merge to main (daily/weekly)
```

**Pros:**
- Clean main branch history
- Batched optimizations
- Better for production deployments

**Cons:**
- More complex workflow
- Delayed live updates
- Need dual deployments (staging + production)

### Option 2: Squash Commits on Upload
```
uploads â†’ main branch â†’ squash related commits automatically
```

**Pros:**
- Immediate live updates
- Simpler workflow
- Single commit per upload session

**Cons:**
- Still some commit noise
- Complex squashing logic

### Option 3: Dedicated Media Branch
```
uploads â†’ media branch â†’ GitHub Actions â†’ deploy to main
```

**Pros:**
- Separate media workflow
- Clean main branch
- Automated deployments

**Cons:**
- Complex branch management
- Potential merge conflicts

## Approach: Direct Main Branch Uploads

**Status: âœ… ACTIVE** - Using `main` branch for all uploads (simplified approach)

### Simplified Direct Upload:

#### Workflow:
1. **Admin uploads** â†’ `main` branch (direct to production)
2. **GitHub Actions** â†’ optimize images automatically
3. **Deployments** â†’ automatic via Cloudflare Pages

#### Benefits:
- ðŸŽ¯ **Simple workflow** - no branch management complexity
- ðŸŽ¯ **Immediate deployment** - changes go live automatically
- ðŸŽ¯ **Single source of truth** - main branch is always current
- ðŸŽ¯ **No merge conflicts** - eliminates staging branch issues

#### Implementation:
- âœ… Admin interface targets main branch
- âœ… GitHub Actions process main branch only
- âœ… Direct deployment to production
- âœ… Simplified user experience

This approach balances clean git history with immediate deployment needs.
