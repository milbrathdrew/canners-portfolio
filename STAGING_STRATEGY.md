# Staging Strategy for Commit Spam Reduction

## Current Issue
Every photo upload creates multiple commits in the main branch:
1. Image upload commit
2. Portfolio.json update commit
3. Optimized images commit (from GitHub Actions)

This creates "spam" in the main branch history.

## Proposed Solution: Staging Branch Workflow

### Option 1: Staging Branch with Periodic Merges
```
uploads â†’ staging branch â†’ batch merge to main (daily/weekly)
```

**Pros:**
- Clean main branch history
- Batched optimizations
- Better for production deployments

**Cons:**
- More complex workflow
- Delayed live updates
- Need dual deployments (staging + production)

### Option 2: Squash Commits on Upload
```
uploads â†’ main branch â†’ squash related commits automatically
```

**Pros:**
- Immediate live updates
- Simpler workflow
- Single commit per upload session

**Cons:**
- Still some commit noise
- Complex squashing logic

### Option 3: Dedicated Media Branch
```
uploads â†’ media branch â†’ GitHub Actions â†’ deploy to main
```

**Pros:**
- Separate media workflow
- Clean main branch
- Automated deployments

**Cons:**
- Complex branch management
- Potential merge conflicts

## Implemented Approach: Option 3 (Dedicated Media Branch)

**Status: âœ… IMPLEMENTING** - Using `media` branch for all photo uploads

### Media Branch Implementation:

#### Workflow:
1. **Admin uploads** â†’ `media` branch (all photo commits)
2. **GitHub Actions** â†’ optimize images in `media` branch
3. **Periodic merges** â†’ `media` branch â†’ `main` branch (clean history)
4. **Deployments** â†’ `main` branch only (production)

#### Technical Changes:
- âœ… Created `media` branch for all photo operations
- ðŸ”„ Modify admin interface to target `media` branch
- ðŸ”„ Update GitHub Actions to work with `media` branch
- ðŸ”„ Add merge workflow from `media` to `main`
- ðŸ”„ Configure Cloudflare Pages to deploy from `main` only

#### Benefits:
- ðŸŽ¯ **Clean main branch** - no photo upload noise
- ðŸŽ¯ **Isolated media workflow** - all photo operations in `media`
- ðŸŽ¯ **Controlled deployments** - merge to `main` when ready
- ðŸŽ¯ **Better git history** - main branch for features, media for content

#### Implementation Phases:
1. **Phase 1: âœ… Branch Setup** - Create and configure `media` branch
2. **Phase 2: ðŸ”„ Admin Targeting** - Update admin to use `media` branch
3. **Phase 3: ðŸ”„ Actions Update** - Configure GitHub Actions for `media`
4. **Phase 4: ðŸ”„ Merge Workflow** - Implement periodic `media` â†’ `main` merges

This approach balances clean git history with immediate deployment needs.
